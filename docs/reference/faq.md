# Frequently Asked Questions

#### What are some good Handlebar references
There are two places which should serve as primary resources for trying to understand what is possible with handlebars. The first is the main [Handlebars.js website](https://handlebarsjs.com), but we also have most of the helpers installed from another pacakge called [handlebar helpers](https://github.com/helpers/handlebars-helpers#helpers). You can also find some handlebar help on our [blog](https://blog.spg.ai) and in these [docs](../concepts/handlebars.md).

#### What is the CSO?
The CSO, or Conversation State Object, in Articulate is a snapshot of the conversation at a given point in time. It contains information about the agent, the current action, the past actions, slots, etc. Articulate uses all of this information to decide what to do next.

#### My agent is asking for a slot over and over again, what's wrong?


#### I typed one of my sayings in exactly and Articulate didn't know what to do.

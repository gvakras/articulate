# Terms

The below terms are sorted alphabetically.

## Action
An action is the steps Articulate takes to fulfill a users requests. Actions can call fill slots, call webhooks, and generate responses. In more traditional chatbot terms - Articulates actions could be considered *intents*.

## Agent
An agent is the top level grouping in Articulate. It is synonymous with your chatbot. A single agent can contain multiple categories, actions, sayings, and keywords. Often times agents are given names like `Samson`, `Siri`, or `Alexa`. They can be single purposed or multi-purposed depending on the conversation requirements.

## Category
A category is a grouping under an agent. Categories are mostly organizational. In an enterprise categories might be similar to departments: engineering, sales, marketing, etc.  For smaller chatbots you may only have two categories: small talk and your primary. if you really don't want to you don't have to use categories. In that case just create a "default" category and put all your sayings there.

## Fulfillment
Fulfillment is the process/steps used to satisfy (or fulfill) a users requests. If a user asks to order a pizza the process of identifying what type of pizza the user wants, making a system call (webhook) to enter the order into a system, and responding to the user would fulfill their request.

## Keyword
A keyword is a word or phrase often found inside of a sentence that is important for the fulfillment of an action. For example in order to order a pizza you would need to know what toppings to put on it. So Toppings is an example of a keyword. A keyword can have values (ham) and synonyms for those values (Canadian bacon).

## Modifier
Modifiers are special sayings, directly attached to keywords. For example, yes and no are keywords, but the phrase "sounds right" could also have the same meaning as "yes". Modifiers are called such because they *modify* slot values. They can Add, remove, set, or unset slot values.
